## Development notes

### Architecture

- SurrealDB + Axum + Disk as backend service exposing an API
- Python + Stanza via PyO3 for NLP
- Svelte frontend that interacts with the API 
- Tauri as a desktop client
- fsrs-rs for SRS algorithm

### For future self

- Use `toml = "0.8.8"` for toml settings parsing and editing.
- Current implementation is for rapid development. Change all unwrap to proper error handling. 
- File on disk could lead to race condition, but probabily won't encounter in single user situation
- Language settings could be on disk
- security? account? whatever for now as it's localhost

### Future features

- [ ] markdown rendering?
- [ ] video support
- [ ] audio support
- [ ] pdf + ocr support?

### Setting up python

Try not using conda, it didn't work
Try not using mac's built-in python, it didn't work
Installing stanza in virtual environment doesn't work for some reason. have to install it on the system python

```sh 
brew install python@3.10
brew install pipenv
python3.10 -m pip install stanza
pipenv install
pipenv shell

rm /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python\@3*/**/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED
```
